                <h2>History of BMX</h2>
                <p>
                    BMX (Bicycle Motocross) is a type of off-road bicycle racing that originated in the late 1960s in Southern California. It was initially inspired by motocross racing, 
                    with participants using modified bicycles to emulate the style and excitement of motocross.

                    bicycles and began to modify them for better performance on dirt tracks and jumps.

                    The Bunny Hop is one of the fundamental tricks in BMX riding. It involves lifting both the front and rear wheels of the bike off the ground simultaneously.
                    To perform a Bunny Hop, start by bending your knees and crouching low on the bike. Quickly pull up on the handlebars while pushing your feet down on the pedals.
                    As the bike comes off the ground, tuck your knees towards your chest to achieve maximum height. Level the bike out by extending your legs and then land both wheels back on the ground.

                <p class="tricksTextContainer hidden" id="trickTextContainer2">
                    A Manual is a trick where you balance on the rear wheel of the bike while rolling. Start by riding at a moderate speed. Shift your weight towards the rear of
                    the bike while gently pulling up on the handlebars. Keep your arms straight and your body centered over the rear wheel. Use small adjustments to maintain your
                    balance as you roll on the rear wheel. To exit the manual, shift your weight forward and gently lower the front wheel back to the ground.

                    The Tailwhip is an advanced trick that involves spinning the frame of the bike around while in the air. Begin by gaining some air off a ramp
                    or jump. As you leave the ground, kick the back end of the bike with your lead foot and let go of the handlebars. Simultaneously, kick the bike
                    frame around 360 degrees with your legs. As the frame completes the rotation, catch the handlebars with your hands and land back on the pedals.

                    The 360° Spin is a trick where you perform a full rotation in the air while keeping the bike beneath you. Approach a ramp or jump with enough speed to gain air.
                    As you leave the lip, use your shoulders and arms to initiate the spin. Turn your head and shoulders in the direction of the spin and use your arms to guide the
                    bike around. Keep your eyes on the landing and complete the 360-degree rotation before landing smoothly.

                    stability. As you approach the end of the rail, ollie off to clear the obstacle and land smoothly.
